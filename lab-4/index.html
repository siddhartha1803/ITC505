        <h2>Act III, Scene III</h2>
        <h3>Another part of the forest</h3>

        <p><em>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind</em></p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in deed and word? is it a true thing?</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning; and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        I do, truly; for thou swear'st to me thou art honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        Would you not have me honest?</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</p>

        <p><strong>JAQUES</strong> <em>(Aside)</em><br>
        A material fool!</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</p>

        <p><strong>AUDREY</strong><br>
        I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness! sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.</p>

        <p><em>Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</em></p>

        <p><strong>JAQUES</strong><br>
        I will not only see thee married, but also marry thee: for here comes the priest of the parish.</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Saluteth, sir Oliver! Here comes the lady whom I would marry, and here is her friend. Give us your blessing, sir: marry us straight.</p>

        <p><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong><br>
        I am always ready to do you service, sir. What is your will?</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        That he do marry us.</p>

        <p><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong><br>
        Is there none here to give the woman?</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        I will not take her on gift of any man.</p>

        <p><strong>JAQUES</strong><br>
        Proceed, proceed: I'll give her.</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Good even, good Master Oliver: I will marry you if ever I marry woman, and I'll be married by you.</p>

        <p><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong><br>
        Well, the gods give thee joy!</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong><br>
        Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor: and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</p>

        <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

        <h2>Addendum: What I changed and why it helps</h2>
        <p class="addendum-intro">
          My goal was to make a text-heavy scene easy to scan while keeping the original HTML meaning from Lab 2. I focused on readable type, calm colors, clear speaker cues, and consistent spacing.
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li><b>Typefaces.</b> Headings use <i>Inter</i> for crisp section labels; paragraphs use <i>Merriweather</i> for comfortable long-form reading at 16px.</li>
          <li><b>Sizes.</b> h1 is prominent but not oversized; h2 and h3 step down clearly; body keeps a relaxed line-height so dense speeches don’t feel cramped.</li>
          <li><b>Color.</b> Off-white background with dark text for contrast; a subtle indigo accent only for titles, rules, and links—keeps it literary and not flashy.</li>
          <li><b>Spacing.</b> A ~65–70ch content width, steady section gaps, and extra room between list items make the page feel organized and less tiring to read.</li>
          <li><b>Dialogue styling.</b> The speaker’s name (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) appears in small caps with a fixed gutter width, so the eye can track who’s speaking quickly. Stage directions (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) are set off with a soft left rule.</li>
          <li><b>HTML abuse.</b> I kept the document outline faithful: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the play title, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the act/scene group, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for location. All visual decisions are done in CSS, not by picking a heading just for its default size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="closing-note">Overall, the page reads like a printed script adapted for the screen—clean, consistent, and easy to follow on a laptop.</p>
